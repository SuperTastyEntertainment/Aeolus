# Aeolus
This project is a mobile game for Android. The gameplay is a side scrolling action platformer, in the same vein as Metal Slug!
However, there are two differentiations in game mechanics: gravity (flappy bird), wind boost (novel idea).

# Story
The story takes place in the skies of Venus! Our hero Aeolus takes his newly made flight suit for a ride.
(should the main character be a person, animal or robot?) 
What dangers await out intrepid explorer? Can he get to the other floating platforms and colonies before dying?

ONLY YOU CAN DECIDE THE FATE OF...
